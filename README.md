## Contents (README)

This repo contains two files:

- **run_analysis.R** — A script to clean, combine, and summarize data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" summarizing Samsung Smartphone accelerometer data.
- **CodeBook.md** — A codebook and process file that outlines how to run the script, the output that it produces, the values, column names, and formats in the resulting output, and the processes used to arrive at it.

These materials have been prepared for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course, week 3 (project).
