## Contents (README)

This repo contains two primary files:

- **run_analysis.R** — A script to clean, combine, and summarize data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" summarizing Samsung Smartphone accelerometer data.
- **CodeBook.md** — A codebook and process file that outlines how to run the script, the output that it produces, the values, column names, and formats in the resulting output, and the processes used to arrive at it.

Also included are:

- **Mean_and_Std_Complete.txt** — Sample output from the script's first task—a cleaned dataset combining test/ and train/ data with human-readable labels and column names, and only mean and standard deviation data included.
- **Mean_and_std_Summary.txt** — Sample output from the script's second task—a summary file giving tidy mean data for each subject, activity, and variable combination.

These materials have been prepared for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course, week 3 (project).
